# Code Journal for Thesis

Since writing the essay, the thesis is pivoted towards exploring external tools suggested language servers
that can be integrated with talon. This journal is an attempt at structuring my work from here on out.
Up until this point i have been experimenting with generating talon commands using tree sitter and pure script.
Starting next friday, i will have meetings with my supervisor every other week, so it is time to start producing.

## 20.10.20

Working on getting set up with latex.
I tried using petters thesis as a template, but was having problems with rubber.
After removing the completion of the documentation, i got it installed, but the project was still not compiled.
Furthermore, inotifywait is not supported on mac. 

Currently looking at the essay to see if i can keep using that.
I'm not sure if there's anything wrong with my current set up.
At some point i should figure out how to have multiple source files.

Goal for today is just to set up a thesis project and begin a rough outline.

## 21.10.20

Starting to work on that outline. Would also be nice if i could hook up some citations today.

Had to detour to rewriting the latex commands from the old api.
Finally figured out how to use list correctly in the new api.
There's no need for defining custom captures.
Guess i should have read the documentation.

Didn't do much on the outline.
After group session i read a bit from the NatLink paper.

## 22.10.20

Spent the morning writing the bekk article, followed by workout and study group, so no outline today either.

## 23.10.20

Slow day... gonna try to start on that outline. It's 13 pm already :(

Actually fleshed out the outline a bit. Starred a bunch of papers on google scholar, but haven't figured out how to cite them.

Figured out how to cite. Google scholar has a quotation button which can generate biblatex sources.
Also installed mendeley extension. Will see how much I end up using tha, but it looks like a nice system.
Added sections about lsp, tree sitter and elm.

Started looking at the sample paper i got from Yngve. Next step is to work their structure into my paper.

## 27.10.20

Yet another slow day. Group session at 12, spent time on HLS.

Got to writing a bit about methodology. Still a lot I'm unsure about, but covered a few ways of evaluating the system.
