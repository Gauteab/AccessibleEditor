# Code Journal for Thesis

Since writing the essay, the thesis is pivoted towards exploring external tools suggested language servers
that can be integrated with talon. This journal is an attempt at structuring my work from here on out.
Up until this point i have been experimenting with generating talon commands using tree sitter and pure script.
Starting next friday, i will have meetings with my supervisor every other week, so it is time to start producing.

Working on getting set up with latex.
I tried using petters thesis as a template, but was having problems with rubber.
After removing the completion of the documentation, i got it installed, but the project was still not compiled.
Furthermore, inotifywait is not supported on mac. 

Currently looking at the essay to see if i can keep using that.
