Hello!
I've been given the opportunity to write about voice coding for my master thesis.
Basically, starting now and until May, I will be working "full time" with voice coding/talon related things.
During this time I hope to be able to contribute something meaningful to the project.
For example, since I will have to write a good amount about how this stuff works in the background section
so I might have good opportunity to contribute to documentation.
I might also want to do a survey of the users of talon, and possibly do interviews as well.
In this case I would be interested in hearing if you have any questions that you would like to have on such a survey.
If you have any ideas for things you would like me to work on that could also be useful for my thesis, I'm all ears :)

Beyond the general stuff, the core idea for my thesis revolves around
looking at ways to integrate talon with other programming tools such as language servers
to improve programming proficiency.
I have experimented a bit with generating commands from identifiers in a file, and I would like to expand on that.

I have been given about freedom by my supervisor, so nothing about my thesis is set in stone, but I hope this
is enough of a foundation for a proper master thesis.

Love to hear your thoughts!
