- How long have you been programming?
p1: 16
p2: 1-2
p3: 14
p4: 25
p5: 20
p6: 25

- How long have you been using Talon or other Voice Coding systems?
less than one year
1-2 years
used vanilla Dragon, switch to talon after Windows release
2-3 months
1 year, but not haavily
1 year

- How much do you use Talon compared to keyboard and mouse in your day to day work?
80% voice 20% keyboard, usuall use mouse with talon 
varies based on the task, but mostly talon for programming and longer sessions
mostly talon, some touchpad with on-screen keyboard
60% talon
50/50, but is not using the computer much at all of these days
99%

- Which speech engine are you using?
conformer
Dragon
Dragon

- What command set are you using (is it baased on knausj)?
knausj
knausj
knausj
hacked knausj
heavily customized knausj
fidget knausj

- Are you familiar with Elm or any similar languages such as Haskell or SML?
knows Haskell
no, has some familiarity with FP
no
no
has some experience with Haskell
no

- Do you have experience using Vim?
no
very basic
no
very experienced
somewhat experienced
very experienced


- What are some issues or challenges you experience when programming with Talon?
slower feedback loop, navigation, had to spell things often, new things are harder
cognitive load, boilerplate, vocal fatigue, dictating correctly
navigation, many small issues
navigation, general editing and refactoring, dictating code
becoming fluent, cognitive load, low-level and verbose commands, repetitive dictation and navigation
dictating variable names, misrecognition, homophones, vocal strain

> navigation:5
> vocal fatigue:2
> cognitive load:2
> misrecognition: 2
> dictating variables: 3
> dictating code: 2
> re-factoring: 1
> low-level commands: 2
> slow feedback loop: 1
> verbose commands: 1

# Post Questions

- In general, what is your impression of what you have seen during this session?
seems really useful, had issues installing
very impressed
super helpful, accurate and intuitive
sees potential for being useful
really cool
"I like it for sure"

- Were there any feature you thought was particularly useful?
navigating to functions by name, loading identifiers to talon
selecting nodes easily, navigation, likes the grammar for type definitions
formatting getting picked up that automatically such as with onClick
dictating tab signatures, navigating to literals and tokens
semantic navigation, editing, exposing identifiers is the most important
type awareness, navigation, "everything was better than what I'm currently using"

- Were there any behaviour you found to be strange or unintuitive?
minor issues with grammar conflict (no real issues)
no
vim, the grammar, mostly intuitive
no
the grammar
no

- Are there any features that are not implemented that you think could improve the system?
other editors obviosly, search for variable names and invokations, show occurences of a search in a side buffer
moving nodes, multiple files
languages and editors
moving nodes / re-factoring
multiple files
dictating weird variables, being aware of abbreviations

- Do you feel like the system addresses some of the challenges you have been experiencing with vocal programming?
yes, navigation especially
yes, sees potential in building upon the exposed identifiers
not really for their particular use case, but still thinks it's useful, navigation especially
not sure, would be more useful for global navigation (already has advanced navigation set up)
yes, makes it more high-level
yes

- Based on what you have seen so far, would you be interrested in using a finished version of a system like this?
yes
yes, would be interested in contributing to the project
yes, would like to see the thesis
yes
yes, would like to contribute
yes, would use as soon as their languages are supported
