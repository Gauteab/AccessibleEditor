  abstract = {A system that enables a person to program without typing  is needed because of the high incidents of repetitive stress  injuries among people who program. This paper presents a  design  for  a  system  that  generates  environments  that   enables people to program by voice and a method of  determining if the system is successful. It also shows how  this generator can be used to support entering data and  writing XML documents.},
