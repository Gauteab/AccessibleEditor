\chapter*{Preface}

Over the course of the spring semester of 2019 I started to develop chronic pain my wrists, arms, neck and back.
By the end of the summer, as I was about to enter the masters program, it had gotten to the point where I 
could not use a computer keyboard or smart phone for more than a few minutes at a time.

\paragraph{}
A few months later, I learned that there were people with similar conditions who were able to use 
voice control to productively use the computer, and even do programming.
This seemed extremely far-fetched to me at first, but by the end of that semester
I found myself using voice control for nearly all computer interactions.
Had it not been for this technology, I don't think I would have been able to finish my degree.
It is for this reason I wanted to dedicate my thesis to research this field further, and hopefully contribute
to making the experience better for other people in my situation.

\paragraph{}
This whole thesis, along with all the code, was written almost entirely using Talon, the voice control system
that is the subject of the work presented.
