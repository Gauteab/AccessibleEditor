\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

When I first decided that I wanted to write about this topic for my thesis, many of the details were still very unclear.
I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Yngve Lindsj√∏rn for putting his faith in me,
and agreeing to supervise this project.

I would also like to thank the Talon community for their dedication, hard work, and willingness to help anyone struggling to overcome
the challenges with learning to become proficient with the voice controls.
This project would not have been possible had it not been for their tremendous efforts.

\paragraph{}
Lastly, I would like to thank my family and my partner Lisbeth for their unwavering love and support throughout this process,
as well as my friends from the university for staying in touch online and encouraging me when we were not able to meet in person.
