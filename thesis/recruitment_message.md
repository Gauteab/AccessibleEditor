# Recruitment

I am a student at the University of Oslo and I am writing my master thesis on vocal programming using talon.
The main focus of my thesis is finding ways to make programming with talon more efficient
by using tools like LSP and TreeSitter.

To achieve this I am making a prototype of a system that uses TreeSitter to expose syntactic information
about the program to talon in order to increase accuracy and enable high-level editing, and navigational commands.
In the attached demo I show how this can be used to navigate a file efficiently by taking the
kind of node you wish to navigate to into consideration.
For example, `go type person` will navigate to the declaration of a type called "Person", but ignore
any other identifiers or textual occurrences of the word "person".

To complete my research, I need to conduct a study to evaluate the potential of the system
and I would therefore appreciate the opportunity to interview some of you who already use talon
and observe you using the system.
The interviews should be quite short and I will simply ask a few questions, have you try the system and ask you about your impression of it.

If this seems interesting to you, please contact me so we can find a time to do the interview :)
I hope to start interviews by the end of the month.

All participants will be anonymized in the paper, and I will not be collecting or sharing any personal information.

Hope I will be hearing from some of you!

# Invitation

Hello! I just set up an event so that you can schedule a time for the interview: https://calendly.com/gaute-berge/talon-interview
I set myself available the whole day (6 am to 23 45) just to make sure, but if you can, please choose one of the times in the middle :)
If none of these days work for you, just let me know and we'll figure out something else.
I set the event for an hour, but as I said it shouldn't take that long assuming setting up goes smoothly!
